# Free-throws-in-basketball
Here is a possible summary of the text in about 300 words:

The text is about an analysis of free throw data from professional basketball games between 2006 and 2015. The data includes 620,000 free throws from 32 teams and 1,098 players. The text aims to answer five questions related to free throws:

- How does home vs away affect free throws?
- How does playoffs vs non-playoffs affect free throws?
- How does the time of the game affect free throws?
- Which players are consistent in free throws regardless of any factors?
- How important are free throws for winning or losing the game?

The text reports that the average success rate of free throws was 76%, and it did not vary significantly by home vs away or playoffs vs non-playoffs. However, the success rate increased slightly by 3% over the course of a game, which could be due to various reasons such as pressure or warm-up. The text does not provide any answers to the last two questions, as it ends abruptly.
